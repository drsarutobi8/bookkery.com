This is not my autobiography. I can’t think of anyone other than my children who might want to read that book (and I’m not 100 percent sure they would, either). However, in the spirit of trying to provide some contextual background for my views, what follows is a brief historical perspective. I was born on March 1, 1942, in Mineola, New York—the county seat of Nassau County, Long Island. 

My father started work as a milk-truck driver and ultimately became a dispatcher at the F&M Schaeffer Brewing Company. My mother was a secretary, sold real estate, and eventually became an administrator at a community college. Along with three brothers — one older, two younger—I lived in the same house in Mineola until I left for college, in 1959.

We were a warm, tightly knit, Catholic, middle-class family. Whatever I have done well in life has been a result of my parents’ influence. My father was a very private man with a great love of learning and inner strength that needed no approbation or reinforcement from broader audiences. My mother was enormously disciplined, hardworking, and ambitious for all her children. She drove us toward excellence, accomplishment, and success.

Education was a high priority in the Gerstner household. My parents remortgaged their house every four years to pay for schooling. I attended public grade school, then Chaminade, a Catholic high school in Mineola. I graduated in 1959 and was almost on my way to Notre Dame when Dartmouth College offered me a substantial scholarship. It was a major benefit for our family finances, so I packed off for Dartmouth in September 1959, without ever having set foot on its campus.

Four years later I graduated with a degree in engineering science. I immediately went to Harvard Business School for two years. (Back then one could leave undergraduate school and go directly to business school, a practice that has since, for the most part, been abandoned by business schools.)

Then, at the tender age of 23, I emerged from Harvard and went into business. I joined the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Company in New York City in June 1965. My first assignment was to conduct an executive compensation study for the Socony Mobil Oil Co. I’ll never forget my first day on that project. I knew nothing about executive compensation, and absolutely nothing about the oil industry. Thank goodness I was the low man on the totem pole, but in the McKinsey world one was expected to get up to speed in a hurry. Within days I was out meeting with senior executives decades older than I was.

Over the next nine years I advanced to the level of senior partner at McKinsey. I was responsible for its finance practice and was a member of its senior leadership committee. I was the partner in charge of three major clients, two of which were financial services companies.

The most important thing I learned at McKinsey was the detailed process of understanding the underpinnings of a company. McKinsey was obsessive about deep analysis of a company’s marketplace, its competitive position, and its strategic direction.

When I reached my early thirties, it became clear to me that I didn’t want to stay in consulting as a career. Although I enjoyed the intellectual challenge, the fast pace, and the interaction with top-ranking senior people, I found myself increasingly frustrated playing the role of an advisor to the decision makers. I remember saying to myself, “I no longer want to be the person who walks into the room and presents a report to a person sitting at the other end of the table; I want to be the person sitting in that chair—the one who makes the decisions and carries out the actions.”

Like many other successful McKinsey partners, I had gotten a number of offers to join my clients over the years, but none of the proposals seemed attractive enough to make me want to leave. In 1977, however, I received and accepted an offer from American Express, which was my largest client at that time, to join it as the head of its Travel Related Services Group (basically, the American Express Card, Traveler’s Checks, and Travel Office businesses). I stayed at American Express for eleven years, and it was a time of great fun and personal satisfaction. Our team grew Travel Related Services earnings at a compounded rate of 17 percent over a decade; expanded the number of cards issued from 8 million to nearly 31 million, and built whole new businesses around the Corporate Card, merchandise sales, and credit card processing industries.

I also learned a great deal. Early on I discovered, to my dismay, that the open exchange of ideas—in a sense, the free-for-all of problem solving in the absence of hierarchy that I had learned at McKinsey—doesn’t work so easily in a large, hierarchical-based organization. I well remember stumbling in my first months when I reached out to people whom I considered knowledgeable on a subject regardless of whether they were two or three levels down from me in the organization. My team went into semi-revolt! Thus began a lifelong process of trying to build organizations that allow for hierarchy but at the same time bring people together for problem solving, regardless of where they are positioned within the organization.

It was also at American Express that I developed a sense of the strategic value of information technology. Think about what the American Express Card represents. It is a gigantic e-business, although we never thought about it in those terms in the 1970s. Millions of people travel the world with a sliver of plastic, charging goods and services in many countries. Every month they receive a single bill listing those transactions, all translated into a single currency. Concurrently merchants are paid around the globe for transactions completed by hundreds, if not thousands, of people whom they do not know and may never see again. All of this is done for the most part electronically, with massive data processing centers worldwide. The technology imperative of this business was something I wrestled with for many years.

This was also when I first discovered the “old IBM.” I’ll never forget the day one of my division managers called and said that he had recently installed an Amdahl computer in a large data center that had historically been 100-percent IBM equipped. He said that his IBM representative had arrived that morning and told him that IBM was withdrawing all support for his massive data processing center as a result of the Amdahl decision. I was flabbergasted. Given that American Express was at that time one of IBM’s largest customers, I could not believe that a vendor had reacted with this degree of arrogance. I placed a call immediately to the office of the chief executive of IBM to ask if he knew about and condoned this behavior. I was unable to reach him and was shunted off to an AA (administrative assistant) who took my message and said he would pass it on. Cooler (or, should I say, smarter) heads prevailed at IBM and the incident passed. Nevertheless, it did not go out of my memory.

I left American Express on April 1, 1989, to accept what some in the media called at the time the “beauty contest” of the decade. RJR Nabisco, a huge packaged-goods company that had been formed a few years earlier through the merger of Nabisco and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, was rated the ninth-most-admire
